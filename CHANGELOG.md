# Changelog

All notable changes to `fastapi-canon` are documented in this file.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Renamed the public success contract from `Response` to `CanonResponse` to
  avoid collisions with response classes commonly used in FastAPI routers.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Required feature names and feature-aware composition diagnostics.
- Composition-level `router_factory` support for shared prefixes, tags,
  dependencies, and custom `APIRouter` subclasses.
- Lazy Dishka provider construction from provider classes and zero-argument
  factories.
- Reusable normalized HTTP exception contracts through
  `ErrorRegistry.responses(http_statuses=[...])`.
- Immutable success response contracts through `Response` and the `json()`,
  `empty()`, `stream()`, `binary()`, and `sse()` constructors.
- Combined success, domain-error, and normalized HTTP documentation through the
  `success=` argument to `ErrorRegistry.responses()`.

### Changed

- OpenAPI compilation replaces FastAPI's generated success media type when a
  `Response` contract is declared.
- Documentation now defines composition ownership of the generated Dishka
  container and safe handling of public Problem Details fields.

### Fixed

- Manual FastAPI response definitions without canon metadata are accepted.
- SSE, PDF, readiness, and other non-problem response contracts remain valid
  when an error registry is installed.
- Domain codes that conflict with generated `http_<status>` discriminator values
  are rejected during response compilation.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Immutable feature composition for FastAPI routers, Dishka providers, error
  registries, exception handlers, and lifespans.
- RFC 9457 Problem Details rendering shared by runtime handlers and OpenAPI.
- Domain, validation, HTTP exception, response-validation, and unhandled-error
  normalization.
